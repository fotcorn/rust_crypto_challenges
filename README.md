These are solutions for the first set of the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/) written in Rust.

Currently rust-crypto only works with Rust nightly (2e3b0c051 2015-04-01).

The code in this project is by no means idiomatic Rust, so pull requests for enhancing it are very welcome!
