These are solutions for the first set of the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/) written in Rust.

You need a current nightly build (not older than 2014-04-03) or the 1.0.0 beta of Rust.

The code in this project is by no means idiomatic Rust, so pull requests for enhancing it are very welcome!
